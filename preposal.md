# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My first idea is to create a variation of the game Snake. I always enjoyed playing the Snake game when I was in intermediate and middle school and being able to create my own version of it would be pretty cool. I plan on trying to make my final project have a person controlling two snakes at once. I plan on going about this by controlling one snake with the arrow keys and the other with 'wasd'.
To follow up on creating a snake game another thing I feel like I can do is to make the snake grow much faster with eat apple it eats. I always hated having to restart back to one whenever I would lose in snake, increasing the pace of the game would be an good idea. 
I could also instead of the snake being trapped in a rectangle I can change the border as well into a different shape to make players have to figure out a different way of beating the game instead of the certain patterns you must do to beat the original snake game. 
I also want to change the way the snake would look so it can be recongized as something else instead of a snake possibly a eel,worm, centipede, or snail.
