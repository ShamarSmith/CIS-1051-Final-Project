Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have completed my entire code to begin the game where the centipede is able to move with arrow keys and wasd. As well as randomly placing the apple/insect to a random grid whenver the centipede comes in contact with an insect. As well as increasing the centipede's length each time it comes into contact with an insect.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to add more finishing touches to make centi more different than the oringinal snake game. Im trying to learn how I could change the insect grid block to like an actual picture of like a insect so it could look appealing visually as well as change the background to like grassy environment.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The biggest problem I encountered as of right now is that being on Mac has trimed my grid out with the full grid now being in picture of the game window. No matter what I do the bottom of the grid goes down further than what the player can see and sometimes an insect would spawn down there rendering the player unable to see the insect in some cases.
