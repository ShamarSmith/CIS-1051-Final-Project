# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

centipede

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I plan on creating a snake clone and changing the snake to look similar to a centipede as well as the apple the snake would usaully eat into a small insect.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My final project will be played similarlly to snake but has differences that include visually and gameplay wise. I'm still deciding on what I want to do to make the game be played differently. Althought I am set on changing the snake, apple, and background to make the environment of grass. I want to also try to increase the speed of my snake clone to increase the diffculty and to also replicate how fast centipedes are compared to the insects they hunt as prey. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I dont plan on using my final project for another class

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No, I am working by myself

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what I will acomplish buliding the snake game from scratch using a tutorial as there is no way I could fail this by doing so by walking through a tutorial.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is if I'm able to complete everything I was planning on achieving in my preposal.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project is if i'm able to impilment more creativity during the creation of my final as it will make it more different from the actual game of snake.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

New skills I will have to acquire is understanding pygame. I never used pygame before and I dont know what to expect from it but I hope I dont run into anything I havent yet from this class yet.Topics I will need to research is how to make a single square that an apple will spawn at to changing that square or apple into a image of a small insect. I also want the centipede to look similar to a centipede with each square that gets added to the centipede having a pair of legs along with it to replicate the hundreads of legs a centipede can have. As well as changing the background to a grassy area instead of a plain black screen that the basic snake game usaully haves. That are the only things I want to add to my final that is a little cloudy for me to acomplish, but everything else I plan on doing I learned how to do already in class.
